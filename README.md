### This is repository started as just an Alpine.js crash course playground but eventually spiraled out of control and became an Alpine.js + Tailwindcss + Github CLI practice playground.

Initially I was just gonna use this repo to store anything that came out of me going through Austin Shelby's [Alpine.js crash course]
