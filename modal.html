            Tanjiro & Nezuko, a tragic but wholesome story
          </h1>
          <p class="pt-3">
            Nezuko was originally an ordinary girl born into a poor yet happy
            family. The secondborn of the six Kamado siblings, Nezuko maintained
            a strong bond with her mother and siblings. After a demon sneaked
            into their house and killed everyone, the only survivors of the
            massacre were Nezuko and her older brother Tanjiro who had been away
            at the time. Nezuko was only able to survive because Kibutsuji had
            transformed her into a demon. Unfortunately this meant Nezuko had a
            strong craving for human blood and initially attacked Tanjiro.
            Nezuko was able to hold back her urge to devour and after Tanjiro
            convinced a Demon Slayer, Tanjiro got the necessary information to
            train under a retired Demon Slayer to be able to protect her now
            controlled sister.
